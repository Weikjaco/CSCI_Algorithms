Objective: Learn and implement a doubly linked list.

Takes in a valid file and reads in the number of applicants (N), selector ones
number (k), and selectors two numbers (m). The selectors will loop around the
linked list - looping an amount of nodes based on the numbers given to them.
If the selectors land on the same node, the node becomes a politician. 
Otherwise the two nodes are eliminated from the linked list.
